# AWS_EMR
Map Reduce 
Learn to run a Map Reduce program(using Python) in the Amazon cloud EMR service

We will use AWS EMR on the Enron email dataset:
http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/enron-email-data/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal
This dataset contains 1,227,255 eMails from Enron employees. The version we use consists of 50 GB of compressed files.

Input files - Accessing the enron data
http://s3.amazonaws.com/enron-scripts/enron-urls-small.txt (smaller set)
http://s3.amazonaws.com/enron-scripts/enron-urls.txt (Larger set)

- Step-1: From the above input files, we extract the required data(DateTimestamp, sender, recipient)

- Step-2: The output of Step-1 is passed to the Enron-Wordcount-Mapper.py, which selects the following records
            Filter the data to
            - only consider emails between 2001-09-05 and 2001-09-08 (including)
            - only consider messages going from ENRON employees to someone not part of the organization
            - Count the number of such foreign interactions and only include accounts (senders) that have more than one outside contact that week.
            
- Step-3: The output of the mapper function will be passed to the Enron-Wordcount-Reducer.py

- Step-4: Merges the output file(s) from Reducer jobs into one single file, using s3distcp(s3-dist-cp in AWS EMR)
      Add a step in AWS EMR, JAR location "command-runner.jar" and in the 'Arguments' give the following:
      s3-dist-cp --src=s3://bucket-name/folder --dest=s3://bucket-name/folder2 --groupBy=.*(to_be_grouped_by).*
 Note: The groupBy argument is quite useful, The files will be grouped by the wildcards(regexp) inside the parenthesis. Refer http://mlpebbles.blogspot.nl/2014/03/note-to-myself-on-s3distcp.html

Tips:
Before running the code in AWS EMR, try running the python code locally in your laptop. It would be easier to debug locally than in EMR
python Enron-Wordcount-Mapper-Details.py < part-000000 | python sort.py > temp0.out
python Enron-Wordcount-Reducer.py < temp0.out > final0.out
